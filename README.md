## About Game

SoloTest is the name of Peg Solitaire in Turkey. Additionally, SoloTest includes points and letters based on the remaining pegs after the game ends.

SoloTest has rude words for 9, 8 and 7 remaining pegs so I've included them in this app. Please bear in mind if you see rude words.

## Objective

The objective of the game is to empty the board and leave only one peg in the central square.

## How To Play

A valid move is to jump a peg orthogonally over an adjacent peg into a hole two positions away and then to remove the jumped peg.
